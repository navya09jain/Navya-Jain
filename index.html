          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>I started Web Development when I was in the first year of my college and after that there is no going back. I just wanted to learn more and more about it and make it my career. It's actually something I will never get bored of and can never say no to. I've made projects and I still am exploring in the domain to learn more.

              <h3>Content Writing</h3>
              <p>Another skillset of mine is Content Creation. I write blogs sometimes and I actually got into content creation just before 1 year where I was in some community in my college and I was in the content domain. I do it both professionally and personally for me as well.

          <h3>Art</h3>
          <p>This skillset of mine is in the world of art , I love to paint and have started this since I was little and obviously have improved and only improved till now. I do this because it gives me peace and calms my mind but not professionally.
